# Password-Strength-Evaluation

Create a Strong Password and Evaluate Its Strength
# Objective
Understand what makes a password strong and test it against password strength tools. This task builds awareness of password security and best practices.
# Tools Used
Online password strength checker: passwordmeter.com (free)
# Steps Followed
Created multiple passwords with varying complexity (uppercase, lowercase, numbers, symbols, length variations).
Tested each password on the strength checker tool.
Noted scores and feedback from the tool.
Identified best practices for creating strong passwords.
Wrote down tips learned from the evaluation.
Researched common password attacks (brute force, dictionary).
Summarized how password complexity affects security.
Passwords Tested and Results
Password 1: "qwerty" - Score: 20% (Very Weak). Feedback: Too short, no mix of characters, common word—vulnerable to dictionary attacks.
Password 2: "qwerty987" - Score: 60% (Medium). Feedback: Good length, but predictable patterns.
Password 3: "Rock_0b0++0m" - Score: 90% (Strong). Feedback: Excellent mix, resistant to brute force.
Password 4: "gS|Yvabh5#5F_24%3e" - Score: 100% (Very Strong). Feedback: Long passphrase, hard to crack.
Research on Attacks and Best Practices
# Common Attacks:
Brute Force: Tries all possible combinations—defeated by length and complexity.
Dictionary: Uses word lists—avoid common words or phrases.
Best Practices/Tips Learned:
Use at least 12-16 characters.
Include uppercase, lowercase, numbers, and symbols.
Use passphrases (random words strung together) for memorability.
Avoid reusing passwords or personal info.
Enable multi-factor authentication (MFA) for extra security.
Use password managers to generate/store strong ones.
How Complexity Affects Security: Stronger passwords increase the time/effort for attacks, making them impractical (e.g., a weak password cracks in seconds, strong in years).
# What I Learned
A strong password combines length and variety to resist attacks.
Tools like password meters help evaluate strength quickly.
MFA and managers are key for real-world security.
Key Concepts: Password strength, brute force attack, dictionary attack, authentication, best practices.
